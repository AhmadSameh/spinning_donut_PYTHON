# spinning_donut_PYTHON
this is still a work in progress of the famous rotating donut in python

## Mathematical Steps
1- draw a circle using the circle equation 

2- rotate the circle by multiplying the circle equation with the y-axis rotation matrix
3- to make the donut look cool rotating, multiply by both x-axis and z-axis rotations matrices 
4- to get light intensity multiply the normal of each point with the direction of light
5- the result of previous step yeilds a number between 0 and root 2
6- multiply this number by 8 and you will have a number representing the light intensity 
7- map ASCII codes with the previous number

# DISCLAIMER
i am still trying to figure things out with this code on my own and try to copy minimum amount of code as possible
